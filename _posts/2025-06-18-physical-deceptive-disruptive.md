### Deceptive and Disruptive Methods

− Honeypot: A fake sub-system in the system designed to look real and attractive for attackers. May be used to delay attack or to alert the organisation that a breach has occurred. <br>
− Honeynet: Multiple honeypots <br>
− Honeyfile: A honeypot that is a file <br>
− Honeytoken: A trackable piece of data that is not actually important. For example a username-password pair. If this pair is used to try and log into one of the organisation's systems then an alert will be sent that a breach has occurred.

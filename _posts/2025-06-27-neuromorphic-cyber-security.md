### What is Neuromorphic Computing?

Neuromorphic computing is the exciting field of developing systems that mimic how the brain works.

You may be familiar with more traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) that do take inspiration from our brain's Biological Neural Networks (BNNs). This approach has led to many breakthroughs including the recent Large Language Model (LLM) boom; names like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude have become ubiquitous.

One way that ANNs often differ from BNNs is that in a typical ANN every neuron is connected to every other neuron in the subsequent layer. This "fully connected-ness", combined with the traditional design choice of having every neuron activate in every propagation cycle, means that an immense number of connections are constantly active which leads to high energy consumption.

One proposed solution to this issue is neuromorphic computing, and specifically developing Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) which stay more faithful to BNNs and only activates a neuron when a certain spike threshold has been reached. This is analogous to how in our brain, neurons only activate when they reach a certain electrical excitement threshold. This essentially means that in an SNN design neurons only activate when they are needed, promoting efficiency.

Neuromorphic hardware designs physical systems that stay true to the human brain. These systems are inherently suited to run SNNs more efficiently. Notable neuromorphic hardware projects include Intel's Loihi Neuromorphic Processor, IBM's NorthPole Neuromorphic Chip, and the University of Manchester's SpiNNaker Large-Scale Neuromorphic Machine.

### Advantages of Neuromorphic Computing

- Energy Efficiency: In SNNs since neurons are not activated when the spike threshold is not reached the system saves energy.
- Low Latency: SNN's are inherently suited for parallel processing which leads to different operations being completed concurrently which improves overall speed.
- Time-based Tasks: SNNs naturally encode and process time-based information through spikes, this means tasks that need a sense of temporal dynamics, such as motion detection or LLMs that accurately deal with conversation context, may be very suited for neuromorphic computing methods.

### Disadvantages of Neuromorphic Computing

- Training Difficulty: Due to being a less mature field than traditional ANNs, SNNs can be difficult to train with less options for tooling and methods. For example, since spiking functions are non-differentiable, gradient descent-based backpropagation is not possible.
- Steep Learning Curve: There is a need to understand multiple domains such as neuroscience and computer science deeply to be able to further neuromorphic computing. Because of this, the knowledge barrier-to-entry can be quite high.

### Possible Implications for Cybersecurity

As a cybersecurity enthusiast, I would be remiss to not mention the security implications of neuromorphic computing.

- Threat Detection: It has been shown that neuromorphic computing excels at pattern recognition tasks [1, 2], possibly from the notion that SNNs try to replicate our brain's plasticity. This ability can be applied in the realm of (automated) threat detection.
- Adaptive Access Control: SNNs may be suited to learn from user behaviour over time and adjust trust levels based on context like time and location to restrict access behind more layers of authentication.
- Additional Attack Vectors: Although new technologies like SNNs will help defensive systems, attackers can also utilise similar technologies to try and develop new angles and methods of attacks.

### Final Thoughts

Neuromorphic computing brings a wealth of new possibilities and areas to explore, in particular for the kind of mind that enjoys learning about many different fields and trying to combine them. I would like to think of myself as in this category.

Going forward, I will be starting the third year of my Computer Science undergraduate degree at the University of Manchester, home of SpiNNAker, one of the world's most prominent pieces of neuromorphic hardware. I hope to combine neuromorphic computing and cybersecurity for my third year project (more on this in a later post) and cannot be more excited to contribute to these growing and exciting fields.

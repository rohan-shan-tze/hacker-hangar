### AAA

A framework used so that people can access remote resources safely.

Think of accessing resources as a process involving requesting and receiving a resource.

Identification - check who the requester is (not part of AAA per se, but a preliminary step).
Authentication - Verify the requester is who they claim to be.
Authorisation  - Allow the requester to access the appropriate resources — no more, no less.
Accounting - Keep a log of what resources were accessed by whom.

#### Method of Authentication

- Using digital certificates.
- Use a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) system.
- The requester presents a certificate signed by the trusted CA.
- The resource server will have a CA certificate.
- If the resource server's CA is the same CA that signed the requester's certificate, the requester is who they claim to be.

#### Method of Authorisation

- We could manually assign each user access to various resources but this is unscalable.
- Imagine having 100 users and 100 resources. Assigning access manually would be extemely time-consuming.
- Instead, we use an abstraction system where we create *groups*.
- Each group has access to certain resources.
- Instead of assigning resources to users, we assign users to groups.

#### Example: Group-Based Authorisation

Instead of assigning resources to each user individually, use **groups**:

- **Users**: A, B, C, D, E, F  
- **Resources**:  
  - Company Accounting Records  
  - Company Financial Plan  
  - Product Source Code (Read/Write)  
  - Confidential Documents  
- **Groups**:
  - *Accounting*: Gets Accounting Records and Financial Plan  
  - *Software Engineering*: Gets Write Access to Source Code  
  - *C-Suite*: Gets full access

Assign:
- A and B → Accounting  
- C and D → Software Engineering  
- E and F → C-Suite

This example is relatively small, but it is obvious how group-based authentication scales with more users and resources much more efficiently than individual assignments.

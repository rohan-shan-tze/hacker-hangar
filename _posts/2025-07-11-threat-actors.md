Threat actors are people or organisations that intend to cause harm to systems. Let’s take a look at the common threat actor categories (often called malicious actors) and their respective attributes.

---
### Attributes of Actors

* **Origin (Internal / External)** – Internal threats can bypass perimeter controls because they start inside the network.  
* **Level of Funding / Resources** – More resources give attackers a wider range of tools and tactics.  
* **Level of Sophistication** – Higher skill and experience generally make an actor more dangerous.

Now let’s examine the main categories of threat actors.

* Sponsored by a government  
* Conduct long-running campaigns called **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**  
* **Origin:** External

### Unskilled Attacker (Script-Kiddie)

### Shadow IT

* Internal staff who deploy unapproved apps or servers to “get work done,” unintentionally creating security gaps  
* While the lack of intention means that negligent shadow IT may not be considered by all to be "threat actors", they are listed as such by CompTIA
* **Origin:** Internal  
* **Funding / Resources:** Low to Medium (using existing org resources)  
* **Sophistication:** Low to Medium

I am a third year computer science undergraduate student at the University of Manchester with a burning question in my mind: "*What is intelligence, exactly?*". My desire to understand the nature of intelligence has led to my interest in machine learning and the intersection between AI and neuroscience. I also enjoy learning about cybersecurity, as I believe that as the complexity and intelligence of systems grow, so do the risks and dangers. 

I am someone who learns best by explaining concepts to myself and breaking complex ideas down into digestible pieces. This blog is a natural extension of that process: a place where I share my self-explanations and reflections, in the hope that others might learn from my journey as well.

A bit more about me: I am an International Master of chess and have been lucky enough to travel the world while playing competitions. My biggest win was when I beat former world championship contender GM Nigel Short, and my biggest tournament successes were winning the Eastern Asia U-18 Championship and the Malaysian National Games.

Apart from chess, my hobbies include: cooking (and eating!), the gym, various sports such as football, table tennis, badminton and basketball, as well as hiking. I also enjoy learning about psychology, biology, and economics.

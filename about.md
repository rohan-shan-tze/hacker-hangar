I am an incoming third year computer science undergraduate student at the University of Manchester with a burning passion for Machine Learning and the intersection between AI and Neuroscience. I also enjoy learning about cybersecurity, as I believe as the complexity and intelligence of systems grow, so do the risks and dangers. 

I enjoy learning through explaining concepts to myself; breaking down complex ideas into digestible chunks. Then I thought, why not share my self-explanations on a blog? This way others can learn from this journey as well.

A bit more about me: I am an International Master of chess and have won competitions such as the Eastern Asia U-18 Chamionship, the ASEAN UNIVERSITY GAMES twice, and the Malaysia Games (SUKMA). 

Apart from chess, my hobbies include: cooking (and eating), the gym, various sports such as football, table tennis, badminton and basketball, as well as hiking. I also have interests in economics, neuroscience, psychology, business and politics.
